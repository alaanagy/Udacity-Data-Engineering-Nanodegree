## Data Modeling

- What Data Modeling is
- The basic difference between realtional and non-relational databases
- Data modeling with Postgres, define fact and dimension tables (project)
- When to use non-relational database based on business needs
- Data modeling with Apache Cassandra and build ETL pipeline for music straming app (project)


## Cloud Data Warehouses

- Introduction to Datawarehouse 
- The difference between OLAP and OLTP systems and when to use each of them.
- Introduction to cloud computing and AWS, set up Amazon S3, IAM, VPC, EC2, and RDS.
- Implementing Datawarehouses on AWS
- Building an ELT pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages it in Redshift, and transforms it into a set of dimensional tables (project)



## Spark & Data Lakes

- The power of spark, and the problems that spark is designed to solve, the big data ecosystem and how spark fits on it.
- Data Wrangling with Spark, how to use it for cleaning and aggregating big data.
- Setting up Spark clusters with AWS, debugging and optimization for Spark applications. 
- Introduction to data lakes, learn about components and implementation of data lakes using big data technologies.
- Building a data lake and ETL pipeline in Spark that loads data from S3, processes the data into analytics tables, and loads them back from S3 (project)


## Automate Data piplines

- Learn about the components of data pipline including Directed Acylclic graphs (DAGs) on Apache Airflow.
- Data Lineage and set up data piplines schedules, partition data to optimize piplines, investigating data quality issues and write tests to ensure data quality.
- Crating and automating a set of data piplines with Airflow, perform data quality checks (project)


## Capstone Project 
#### (Immigration to the United States, and supplementary datasets will include data on airport codes, U.S. city demographics, and temperature data)

We will gather data from several different data sources; transform, combine, and summarize it; and create a clean database for others to analyze.
